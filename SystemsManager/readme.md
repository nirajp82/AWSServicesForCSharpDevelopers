## [Chapter 1: Introduction to Systems Manager (SSM)|https://github.com/nirajp82/AWSServicesForCSharpDevelopers/blob/main/SystemsManager/01_SSM_Introduction.md]

**AWS Systems Manager (SSM)** is a central management tool for infrastructure on AWS. It allows sysadmins and DevOps teams to:

* Run remote commands
* Patch systems
* Store config secrets
* Monitor software inventory
* Maintain system health
* Automate common admin tasks

🔍 **Why it exists**: To manage thousands of EC2 machines or hybrid nodes *without manually SSH-ing into each box*.

---

## Chapter 2: What Is State Manager?

State Manager is a **declarative management tool**. Its job is to keep your EC2 instances or hybrid servers in a **desired state**.

### 🔑 Key Concept: Desired State

You define *what* you want the system to look like:

* “Always have antivirus X installed.”
* “Ensure `cronjob.sh` is present and executable.”
* “My config file must always contain `ENV=prod`.”

### ⚙️ How State Manager Works

It compares current state with the desired state you define via documents. Then it:

1. Runs a script or automation to enforce that state.
2. Logs the result.
3. Repeats on a schedule or when triggered.

---

## Chapter 3: Understanding SSM Documents

### 📄 What Are SSM Documents?

SSM Documents (also called **Run Command documents** or **Automation documents**) define *what actions* to perform on a target.

They are in **JSON** or **YAML** format and use one of these schemas:

* `AWS::SSM::Document`
* Schema version `2.2` or `0.3`

### 🔧 Document Types

| Type       | Use Case                          | Example                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Command    | Run shell/powershell commands     | `AWS-RunShellScript`          |
| Automation | Multi-step workflows              | `AWS-UpdateLinuxAmi`          |
| Session    | Controls Session Manager behavior | `AWS-StartInteractiveCommand` |
| Package    | Install/uninstall software        | `AWS-ConfigurePackage`        |

### 🔍 Anatomy of a Document

```yaml
schemaVersion: '2.2'
description: "Restart Apache"
mainSteps:
  - action: aws:runShellScript
    name: restartApache
    inputs:
      runCommand:
        - service httpd restart
```

**Sections**:

* `schemaVersion`: Document type version
* `description`: Human-readable explanation
* `mainSteps`: List of actions (like shell commands)

---

## Chapter 4: Association: The Heart of State Manager

An **association** is a binding between:

* a **Document**
* a **Target**
* optional **Parameters**
* a **Schedule**
* **Logging/Compliance** settings

### 🔁 Association Lifecycle

1. Create Association with a Document.
2. Define who it runs on (Targets).
3. Set a schedule or event.
4. AWS SSM enforces the document.
5. Logs the outcome.
6. Reports back success/failure.

### 🧱 Association Configuration Components

| Component  | Purpose                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Document   | The task or script to execute       |
| Targets    | Which EC2/hybrid machines to act on |
| Parameters | Input to the document               |
| Schedule   | CRON or rate-based execution        |
| Compliance | Tracks document execution status    |
| Logging    | Outputs to S3 or CloudWatch         |

---

## Chapter 5: Deep Dive into Parameters

### 🔍 What Are Parameters?

Parameters are inputs passed into the document at runtime.

If the document has:

```yaml
inputs:
  runCommand:
    - echo {{ message }}
```

Then the parameter `message` must be provided.

### 💡 Where Parameters Are Defined

* **In the Document**: Inside `inputs`
* **At Association Time**: Filled via console, CLI, or API

### 🧪 Types of Parameters

| Type         | Description                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| String       | Single value (`"hello"`)    |
| StringList   | Comma-separated (`"a,b,c"`) |
| Boolean      | true/false                  |
| SecureString | Encrypted using AWS KMS     |

## Chapter 6: Target Selection in Associations

### 🎯 Targets Can Be:

* Specific instance IDs (`i-xxxx`)
* Tags (e.g., `Environment=Prod`)
* Resource groups (from AWS Resource Groups)

### 🔀 Dynamic Targeting

Use tags to **automatically apply** associations to new instances:

```json
{
  "Key": "App",
  "Values": ["WebServer"]
}
```

Any EC2 tagged with `App=WebServer` becomes a target without changing the association.

---

## Chapter 7: Scheduling and Automation

### ⏰ Supported Schedule Types

* `rate()` expressions: `rate(1 hour)`, `rate(1 day)`
* `cron()` expressions: CRON syntax in UTC

### 📌 Examples

* Run every day at 3 AM UTC: `cron(0 3 * * ? *)`
* Run every 12 hours: `rate(12 hours)`

Schedule makes the State Manager *self-healing* by retrying if an instance was offline.

---

## Chapter 8: Logging and Compliance Tracking

### 🪵 Logging Options

* **S3**: Stores raw output logs
* **CloudWatch Logs**: Searchable, real-time monitoring

### ✅ Compliance Reports

State Manager generates compliance reports:

* Green: Association successful
* Red: Failed or not run

Use AWS Config + Systems Manager to enforce compliance rules organization-wide.

---

## Chapter 9: Custom SSM Documents

### ✨ Why Create Custom Documents?

* Default documents too generic
* Need multi-step workflows
* Want conditional logic or branching

### 📘 Example: Install and Start Apache

```yaml
schemaVersion: '2.2'
description: "Install Apache"
mainSteps:
  - action: aws:runShellScript
    name: install
    inputs:
      runCommand:
        - yum install -y httpd
        - systemctl start httpd
```

Upload with:

```bash
aws ssm create-document \
  --name "InstallApache" \
  --document-type "Command" \
  --content file://apache.yml
```

---

## Chapter 10: Security & IAM Roles

### 📜 Required Roles

* **EC2 IAM Role** → Must have `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
* **User IAM Role** → Needs access to `ssm:*Association*`, `ssm:SendCommand`, etc.

### 🔒 Document Permissions

You can **share custom documents**:

* Privately
* Across accounts
* Publicly (be careful!)

---

## Chapter 11: Advanced Use Cases

### 🧠 Use Case 1: Enforce Configuration Drift Control

Run a script daily that checks if `/etc/myapp/config.yml` contains correct values.

### 🧠 Use Case 2: Security Agent Enforcement

Create an association that installs antivirus and runs hourly.

### 🧠 Use Case 3: Custom Health Check

Write a shell script that checks services, reports via CloudWatch.

---

## Chapter 12: Real-World Examples

### ✅ Example: Patch Linux Machines Daily

```json
Document: AWS-RunShellScript
Parameters: {"commands": ["yum update -y"]}
Targets: All EC2s with tag Patch=true
Schedule: rate(1 day)
Compliance: Enabled
```

### ✅ Example: Restart App Server on Config Change

Use CloudWatch Event → triggers Association → runs restart script.

---

## Chapter 13: Troubleshooting and Monitoring

### 🔎 Where to Check

1. **SSM Agent Logs**:

   * `/var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log`

2. **State Manager UI**

   * Check execution history and compliance

3. **S3 or CloudWatch Logs**

   * Store detailed command output

4. **AWS Config**:

   * Track changes and compliance drift

---

## Chapter 14: Best Practices and Optimization

* Use tag-based targeting for dynamic scaling.
* Enable logging for audit/compliance needs.
* Combine with AWS Config for remediation workflows.
* Avoid overly broad IAM policies.
* Test documents on single instance before mass-association.
